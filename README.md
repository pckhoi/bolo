# Bolo

Smart pipeline framework that knows how to analyze your Python scripts (without running) and generate Make rules for you. If you specify script inputs and outputs within the script itself, Bolo can pick them up automatically based on pre-defined patterns and write Make rules accordingly. In addition, Bolo mandates a few good rules for sane project management.
